# Phx.Gen.Auth

An authentication system generator for Phoenix 1.5+ applications.

This project generates code from José Valim's [Auth PR][auth pr] and is up to date
through commit: [4664c3](https://github.com/dashbitco/mix_phx_gen_auth_demo/pull/1/commits/4664c376273af7100e31766ccf2d76bc7cf153e4).

## Overview

The purpose of `phx.gen.auth` is to generate a pre-built authentication system into
a Phoenix 1.5+ application that follows both security and elixir best practices. By generating
code into the user's application instead of using a library, the user has complete freedom
to modify the authentication system so it works best with their app. The following links
have more information regarding the motivation and design of the code this generates.

## Usage

### Generating a Phoenix 1.5 app

`phx.gen.auth` must be installed into a Phoenix 1.5+ application.

Once the installer is installed, a new project can be generated by running

    $ mix phx.new my_app

Please note, the `--no-ecto` and `--no-html` options are not supported.

### Installation

After running `mix phx.new`, `cd` into your application's directory (ex. `my_app`).

#### Basic installation

1. Add `phx_gen_auth` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [
        {:phx_gen_auth, "~> 0.3.0", only: [:dev], runtime: false},
        ...
      ]
    end
    ```
1. Install and compile the dependencies

    ```
    $ mix do deps.get, deps.compile
    ```

#### Umbrella installation

1. `cd` into your project's web app directory (ex. `apps/my_app_web`)

    ```
    $ cd apps/my_app_web
    ```
1. Add `phx_gen_auth` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [
        {:phx_gen_auth, "~> 0.3.0", only: [:dev], runtime: false},
        ...
      ]
    end
    ```
1. Install and compile the dependencies

    ```
    $ mix do deps.get, deps.compile
    ```

### Running the generator

From the root of your phoenix app (or `apps/my_app_web` in an umbrella app), you
can install the authentication system with the following command

    $ mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users

This creates the templates,views, and controllers on the web namespace,
and a new `MyApp.Accounts` [context][phoenix contexts guide], in the application
namespace.

Next, let's install the dependencies and migrate the database

    $ mix deps.get
    $ mix ecto.migrate

Let's run the tests and make sure our new authentication system works as
expected.

    $ mix test

Finally, let's start the our phoenix server and try it out.

    $ mix phx.server

#### Note on apps upgraded from Phoenix 1.4

If you've upgraded your app from Phoenix 1.4, you'll need to make the following update to `test/support/conn_case.ex` to get `mix test` to pass:

```diff
using do
  quote do
    # Import conveniences for testing with connections
    import Plug.Conn
    import Phoenix.ConnTest
+   import DemoWeb.ConnCase
    alias DemoWeb.Router.Helpers, as: Routes

    # The default endpoint for testing
    @endpoint DemoWeb.Endpoint
  end
end
```

### Learning more

To learn more about `phx.gen.auth`, run the following command.

    $ mix help phx.gen.auth

You can also look up the mix task in [hexdocs](https://hexdocs.pm/phx_gen_auth).

## Upgrading

Since `mix phx.gen.auth` generates its code directly into your application, upgrading the version
of this library will not upgrade your application's current authentication logic.

To see the changes that have been made to the generator output since the version that was used in
your application, visit the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and click the `[Diff]` links for each
version. These diffs will show you the changes to make to your application so it can be up to date
with the current generator output.
